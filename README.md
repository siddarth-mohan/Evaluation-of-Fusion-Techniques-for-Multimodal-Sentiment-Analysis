The project involved:

Implementing individual models for text and image data using state-of-the-art techniques to capture sentiment cues from respective modalities.
Deploying intermediate and late fusion models to integrate the individual text and image models, leveraging their complementary strengths.
Enhancing overall model performance and accuracy through advanced fusion techniques, resulting in a robust multimodal sentiment analysis solution.
